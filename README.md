# Attacking an image using python

This is mainly the code created for my paper

* "Osama Hosam. “Attacking Image Watermarking and Steganography - A Survey”, I.J. Information Technology and Computer Science, 2019, 3, 23-37

The code is simply a jupyter notebook, it can be displayed directly in github
